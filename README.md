For my Seminar class at Samford University I researched and created a poster about Unemployment and its impact on life expectancy. I created several charts for the poster and used Python's matplotlib to create them. 
The charts are not the prettiest, but they show the information simply and I could easily adjust, add, or remove values as I needed so I thought it was my best option to use this as my way to make the charts. 


Attached in this repo is a copy of my finalized poster.
